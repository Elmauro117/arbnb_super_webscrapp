# arbnb_super_webscrapp
Python scripts that uses Selenium to scrapp all sort of data from each ABNB. We are talking about, prices, places, comentaries, views, permissions, etc. Hope this might be helpful evne in your journey to get a house!

#### Attention:
1.- The file "copy" si the one with the definitions completed. The other one has a lot of code on how I developed it.
2.- In order to make work the def get_todo_de_c_abnb() u will need to declare the definitions that are contained inside of it, you can easily check who they are.
3.- Ahhhh some difinitions are made to interact with the webpage, like sending keys of WHERE, WHEN (DATES), HOSTS.
4.- Ehhhh the first definition on the copy file is a quick webscrap that webscraps URL's like this: https://www.airbnb.com.pe/s/Paris/homes?tab_id=home_tab&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&flexible_trip_lengths%5B%5D=one_week&price_filter_input_type=0&price_filter_num_nights=5&query=Par%C3%ADs%2C%20Francia&place_id=ChIJD7fiBh9u5kcRYJSMaMOCCwQ&date_picker_type=calendar&checkin=2023-05-17&checkout=2023-05-20&adults=1&children=1&infants=1&source=structured_search_input_header&search_type=autocomplete_click            What I mean is that code webscraps the numbers adn words you can see in each block. You are smart u can understand it once u try it.
5.- Due to the webpages often change xpaths and stuff most likel this webscrapp will only work for a few months after MARCH 2023. SO I made a video where I show you the functionality of this: https://youtu.be/bhwppACdbrI        The video is in Spanish but it only shows the functionality so it rly doesnt matter. <3

Hope this helps anyone, tho no one will see it lol. BYE!


6.- The documentation of the Webscrap is in SPANISH so big F
